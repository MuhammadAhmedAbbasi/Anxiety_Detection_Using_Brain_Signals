**Detection Of Anxiety Using Brain Signals:**

**Introduction**

Human anxiety is a grave mental health concern that needs to be addressed in the appropriate manner in order to develop a healthy society. In this study, an objective human anxiety assessment framework is developed by using physiological signals of electroencephalography (EEG) and recorded in response to exposure therapy. The EEG signals of twenty-threesubjects from an existing database called “A Database for Anxious States which is based on a Psychological Stimulation (DASPS)” are used for anxiety quantification into two and four levels. The EEG signals are pre-processed using appropriate noise filtering techniques to remove unwanted ocular and muscular artifacts. Channel selection is performed to select the significantly different electrodes using statistical analysis techniques for binary and four level classification of human anxiety, respectively. Features are extracted from the data of selected EEG channels in the frequency domain. Frequency band selection is applied to select the appropriate combination of EEG frequency bands, which in this study are theta and beta bands. Feature selection is applied to the features of the selected EEG frequency bands. Finally, the selected subset of features from the appropriate frequency bands of the statistically significant EEG channels were classified using multiple machine learning algorithms. An accuracy of 83.00% and 72.74% is attained for two and four-level anxiety classification using a DNN, respectively.
